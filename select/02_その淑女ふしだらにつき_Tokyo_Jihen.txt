I've wined and dined on mulligan stew
And never wished for turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too
From Maine to Albuquerque
Alas I missed the Beaux Arts Ball
And what is twice as sad
I've never been to a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad
Social circles moved too fast for me
My hobohemia is the place to be (aww yeah)
I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I like the theatre but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
I don't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like the free fresh wind in my hair
Life without care, I'm broke, it's okey
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
Girls get massages, they cry and they moan
Let's tell to them to leave me alone
I'm not so hot, but my shape is my own
That's why the lady is a tramp
The food at Compenski's is perfect, no doubt
I couldn't tell you what the Ritz is about
Try me, you're gone and coffee comes out
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like the sweet, fresh rain in my face
Diamonds and lace
No got, so what?
For Frank Sinatra I whistle and I stamp
That's why the lady is a tramp
She is a hobo
She is a scamp
She is no good kind of tramp
That's why the lady is a tramp
