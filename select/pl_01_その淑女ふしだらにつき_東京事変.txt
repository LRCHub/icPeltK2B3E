I've wined and dined on mulligan stew.
And never wished for turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too,
from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas I missed the Beaux Arts Ball.
And what is twice as sad
I've never been to a party
where they honored Noel Ca-ad
Social circles moved too fast for me.
My hobohemia is the place to be
I get too hungry for dinner at eight.
I like the theatre but never come late.
I never bother with people I hate.
That's why the lady is a tramp
I don't like crap games with barons and earls.
Won't go to Harlem in ermine
and pearls. Won't dish the dirt
with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like the free fresh wind in my hair.
Life without care I'm broke, it's oke
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
